-Simple web design for watch and search film, include login and register page, but need to connect to database through XAMPP

# Download and Install XAMPP:

Download XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Start XAMPP:

After installation, start XAMPP.
Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.
Create a Folder for Your Project:

Create a folder in the htdocs directory within your XAMPP installation folder. For example, if you installed XAMPP on Windows, you might create a folder like C:\xampp\htdocs\myproject.
Place Your HTML and PHP Files:

Save your HTML file (e.g., index.html) in the project folder.
Create a PHP file (e.g., process.php) and save it in the same folder.
Access Your Project:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost/myproject/index.html (replace myproject with the actual folder name you created). You should see your HTML form.
When you submit the form, the data will be sent to your process.php script on the server.
Debug and Test:

You can use the XAMPP control panel to access PHP error logs and MySQL databases for debugging and testing as needed.
